DBMS Project

This project focuses on the end-to-end design and implementation of a relational database system for a real-world use case. It aims to provide hands-on experience in analyzing user requirements, modeling data through an ER diagram, converting it into a normalized relational schema, and implementing the database using PostgreSQL. The project also includes writing complex SQL queries to demonstrate the system's ability to answer realistic and meaningful user questions.
